# PyQuotes

This is a simple python program that scrapes quotes from the internet, formats them, saves them in a text file
and then implements a cool and efficient algorithm to read the file and print a single random quote (using a 
dictionary with a quote number as the key and the values being another dict with the start and end file position offsets)
at an interval.
